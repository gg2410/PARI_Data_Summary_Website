    <p>An overwhelming majority of our responses said yes indicating that either we picked a very informed set of interviewees or people may overestimate their response. Yes was followed by 'As often as I can', and No as seen in the graph above.

    <ul class="w3-left">
        <li><h5>Out of 292 responses, 151 interviewees responded no to being aware of PARI, 137 said yes, while 4 responded maybe. Therefore, we had a good mix of people who were interviewed, and the information received takes in a fair bit of input from readers as well as non-readers of PARI.</h5></li>
        <li><h5>Of the few responses on how people came about PARI, 40 heard about PARI through friends, or word of mouth. This was followed by 28 peopl via various social media platforms, and around 18 through this internship. There are also a few people who knew PARI from past research, or familiarity with employees.</h5></li>
        <li><h5>The last question regarding PARI was whether people have read any of their work. As expected, the majority responded No at 178. 102 replied affirmatively, while the remaining preferred not to answer.</h5></li>

            <li><h5> Coming to popular arcives, JSTOR outweighed all others in frequency. Taylor and Francis was the second most common and the other archives were industry specific in very few numbers.</h5></li>
